# Firecracker

Firestore simplified.

## Why?

Firestore is powerful and robust. However the official API seems a little bit too complicated. So I created this to expose limited functionality of Firestore which might hopefully make it easier to use.

## Install

```
npm i @ycm.jason/firecracker
```

## Requirement

This package uses proxy heavily in order to support intuitive chaining api.
